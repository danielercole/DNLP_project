way too overpriced for the quality of food !
horrible service !
flavorless and expensive .
absolutely one of the worst staff experiences i have ever witnessed .
the meat was dry , overcooked and hard .
i would not recommend this salon at all !
bad experience .
hotel was extremely filthy .
all of the workers are incompetent .
the fries were soggy and not tasty .
